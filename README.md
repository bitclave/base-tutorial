#Base Platform Tutorial

This reference application demonstrates how to use BASE API using [BASE JS LIBRARY](https://github.com/bitclave/base-client-js). The application asks user to enter a passphrase to create his private & public keys used to interact with the platform. Either passphrase or private key is never sent to BASE platform. Once user has his keys, he can create his account and use his private key to encrypt his data and save it in the platform.
